# Test Plan for Secure Messaging Application

## Overview
This test plan outlines the strategy for verifying the functionality, security, and performance of the secure messaging system using Flask and WebSockets. The system employs AES encryption for messages and RSA for key exchange.

## Test Environment
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, Flask 2.0+
- **Database**: In-memory (for test), PostgreSQL (for production)
- **Testing Tools**: pytest, pytest-flask, pytest-mock, requests, websocket-client
- **Environments**: Local development, CI/CD pipeline, Staging

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Focused on testing individual components and functions in isolation.

### 2. Integration Tests
Testing interactions between components and modules.

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Testing the complete application flow.

### 4. Security Tests
Specialized tests focusing on the cryptographic and security aspects.

### 5. Performance Tests
Testing the application under various load conditions.

## Test Schedule

1. Unit and Integration Tests: Run on every commit
2. End-to-End Tests: Run daily and before releases
3. Security Tests: Run weekly and before releases
4. Performance Tests: Run before major releases

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Security vulnerability in crypto implementation | Medium | High | Use established libraries, regular code reviews, security testing |
| Performance bottlenecks with many users | Medium | Medium | Performance testing, optimization, scalable architecture |
| WebSocket connection failures | Medium | High | Implement reconnection mechanism, fallback to HTTP polling |
| Incompatibility with older browsers | Low | Medium | Cross-browser testing, feature detection |

## Test Cases Summary

- **Unit Tests**: 30+ tests covering core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 15+ tests covering component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: 5+ scenarios covering major user flows
- **Security Tests**: 10+ tests focusing on cryptographic operations
- **Performance Tests**: 3+ scenarios covering normal and peak loads

## Exit Criteria

- All test cases pass
- No critical or high-severity bugs remain open
- Code coverage > 80%
- All security checks pass
- Performance meets defined SLAs
